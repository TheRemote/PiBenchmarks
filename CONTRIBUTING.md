# Contributing

Hello!  Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project.  That could include reporting issues, pull requests, fixing bugs, writing documentation, translations, anything!

## Looking for support?

The best places to get support are the project's issues section or my blog's comments section.

## How to report a bug

Think you found a bug? Please check the list of open issues to see if your bug has already been reported. If it hasn't please submit a new issue.

Here are a few tips for writing *great* bug reports:

* Describe the specific problem (e.g., "server won't load and log files are showing this specific crash" versus "getting an error")
* Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
* Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies
* Include what version of the project your using, as well as any relevant dependencies
* Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
* Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down
* Always include error output and log files when possible

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and goals of the project.  Sometimes it makes more sense to fork the project if it's beyond the scope of this specific project.

Open an issue which describes the feature you would like to see, why you want it, how it should work, etc.

## How to propose changes

Here's a few general guidelines for proposing changes:

* Each pull request should implement **one** feature or bug fix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix
* Write a good commit message describing what you are changing and why

At a high level, [the process for proposing changes](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is:

1. Fork and clone the project
2. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
4. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged
